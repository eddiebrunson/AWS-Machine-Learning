# AWS Machine Learning Foundations 

### Lesson 5: Machine Learning with AWS DeepComposer

### 4. AWS DeepComposer 

___


AWS Deep Composer uses Generative AI, or specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to generate music. GANs pit 2 networks, a generator and a discriminator, against each other to generate new content.

The best way weâ€™ve found to explain this is to use the metaphor of an orchestra and conductor. In this context, the generator is like the orchestra and the discriminator is like the conductor. The orchestra plays and generates the music. The conductor judges the music created by the orchestra and coaches the orchestra to improve for future iterations. So an orchestra, trains, practices, and tries to generate music, and then the conductor coaches them to produced more polished music.

### AWS DeepComposer Workflow
Use the AWS DeepComposer keyboard or play the virtual keyboard in the AWS DeepComposer console to input a melody.
Use a model in the AWS DeepComposer console to generate an original musical composition. You can choose from jazz, rock, pop, symphony or Jonathan Coulton pre-trained models or you can also build your own custom genre model in Amazon SageMaker.
Publish your tracks to SoundCloud or export MIDI files to your favorite Digital Audio Workstation (like Garage Band) and get even more creative.
