1. To get to the main AWS DeepComposer console, navigate to AWS DeepComposer. Make sure you are in the US East-1 region.
2. Once there, click on Get started
3. In the left hand menu, select Music studio to navigate to the DeepComposer music studio
4. To generate music you can use a virtual keyboard or the physical AWS DeepComposer keyboard. For this lab, we’ll use the virtual keyboard.
5. To view sample melody options, select the drop down arrow next to Input
6. Select Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star
7. Next, choose a model to apply to the melody by clicking Select model
8. From the sample models, choose Rock and then click Select model
9. Next, select Generate composition. The model will take the 1 track melody and create a multitrack composition (in this case, it created 4 tracks)
10. Click play to hear the output

Now that you understand a little about the DeepComposer music studio and created some AI generated music, let’s move on to an exercise for generating an interface. There, you’ll have an opportunity to clone a pre-trained model to create your AI generated music!
